#What is it?
Our device measures the exhalation flow rate via the pressure drop through a venturi. Based on the venturi dimensions, the fluid density, and the pressure drop, the flow rate can be calculated and integrated for the total lung capacity. This information is plotted on a digital display on the device and is also transmitted via bluetooth to a connected android device.
